The rapid advancement in technology allows us to create devices in order to help out those who are in need, which in this particular case are visually impaired people. This device allows the user to gain a sense of their close surroundings by signaling the user if there is an obstacle in front or on the user’s left or right side. One of three ultrasonic sensors is placed in the front of the device which signals the user if there is an obstacle in front by vibration and sound, or just by vibration. The sound indicator can be turned off or on by a switch located near the handle. The other two ultrasonic sensors are placed on the right and left side of the device. Their signal determines whether an indicator attached to a servo motor moves to the left or right side of the user’s hand, informing the user of an obstacle. The device is powered by an external power supply which is connected to the microcontroller by an electrical switch, which allows the user to control when the device is turned on or off, allowing for a more economical device. 

Components used:

•	Arduino Uno Microcontroller

•	Ultrasonic Sensor HC-SR04 – ultrasonic proximity sensor

•	Micro Servo Motor – indicates if there is an obstacle on the right or left side of the user

•	Vibration Motor – indicates if there is an obstacle in front of the user

•	Buzzer (Speaker) – a sound indicator that is used in addition to the vibration motor when an obstacle is in front of the user

•	Electrical Relay – auxiliary component that is used to connect two components to a single output pin

•	Power source

•	Electrical Switch –an on/off switch for the device
